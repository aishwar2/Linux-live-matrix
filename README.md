Enhancements
Here are a few suggestions to enhance your script:

Error Handling: Add specific error handling for SSH and MySQL commands to log issues without stopping the entire script.

Logging: Implement a logging mechanism to track the scriptâ€™s execution, which can be useful for troubleshooting.

Parameterization: Consider externalizing some parameters (like server IPs and credentials) to a configuration file for easier management.
