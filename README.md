# Linux-live-matrix
live web monitoring 0f 8 live Linux server 
Bash Script Overview
Set Error Handling: set -e ensures the script will stop execution if any command fails.

Server List: Define a list of server IP addresses.

User and MySQL Credentials: Define SSH user and MySQL credentials.

Data File Initialization: Initialize a CSV file with headers.

Data Collection Loop:

SSH into Each Server: Collect CPU, RAM, and network metrics using SSH commands.

Date and Time: Get the current date and time.

Append Data to CSV: Append the collected data to the CSV file.

Insert Data into MySQL: Insert the data into the specified MySQL table.

Example Execution
To run the script, ensure you have the necessary SSH access and MySQL credentials configured. Save the script as collect_metrics.sh and make it executable:

sh
chmod +x collect_metrics.sh
./collect_metrics.sh
Enhancements
Here are a few suggestions to enhance your script:

Error Handling: Add specific error handling for SSH and MySQL commands to log issues without stopping the entire script.

Logging: Implement a logging mechanism to track the script’s execution, which can be useful for troubleshooting.

Parameterization: Consider externalizing some parameters (like server IPs and credentials) to a configuration file for easier management.

Does this help you with what you need?


README.md
This is the cornerstone of your repository. It should explain what the project is about, how to set it up, and how to use it.

# Live Server Metrics

This project collects and displays live server metrics including CPU, RAM, and network usage. The data is stored in a MySQL database and visualized using an HTML dashboard.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring
- Data storage in MySQL
- Visual dashboard

## Prerequisites
- MySQL
- PHP
- Apache/Nginx

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd repository
    ```
3. Import the MySQL schema:
    ```sh
    mysql -u root -p linux_db < schema.sql
    ```
4. Update database configuration in `get_metrics.php`:
    ```php
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "root";
    $password = "yourpassword";
    $dbname = "linux_db";
    ```
5. Start the data collection script:
    ```sh
    ./collect_metrics.sh
    ```

## Usage
Access the dashboard by navigating to `http://localhost/` in your web browser.
