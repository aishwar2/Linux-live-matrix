Detailed Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone your repository from GitHub to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
Replace username and repository with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change your current directory to the project directory:
cd repository
3. Database Setup
You need to set up your MySQL database and import the schema.

Start MySQL: Make sure your MySQL server is running. You can start it with:

```sh
sudo service mysql start
Create the Database: Log into MySQL and create the database:
```
```sh
mysql -u root -p
Enter your MySQL root password when prompted. Then, in the MySQL prompt, create your database:
```
```sql
CREATE DATABASE linux_db;
EXIT;
Import the Schema: Import the schema file into your new database:
```
```sh
mysql -u root -p linux_db < schema.sql
4. Configure Your PHP File
Update the get_metrics.php file with your database credentials:
```
``` php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "yourpassword";
$dbname = "linux_db";
Ensure get_metrics.php is set up to fetch and serve your metrics data correctly.
```
5. Configure Web Server (Apache/Nginx)
Make sure your web server is properly configured to serve your HTML dashboard. If you’re using Apache:
### Install Apache:

```sh
sudo apt-get install apache2
Copy Project Files: Copy your project files to the web server root directory:
```
``` sh
sudo cp -r /path/to/your/project/* /var/www/html/
Restart Apache:
```
```sh
sudo service apache2 restart
If you’re using Nginx, the steps are similar but involve configuring your nginx.conf file.
```
6. Running the Data Collection Script
Make sure your data collection script (collect_metrics.sh) is running and collecting data:
Make the Script Executable:
``` sh
chmod +x collect_metrics.sh
Run the Script:
```
``` sh
./collect_metrics.sh
This script will SSH into your servers, collect metrics, and store the data in your MySQL database and a CSV file.
```
Optional: Automation with Systemd
If you want the data collection script to run automatically, you can create a systemd service:
Create a Service File:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/collect_metrics.service
Add the Following Content:
```
ini
[Unit]
Description=Collect Server Metrics

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/collect_metrics.sh
Restart=always
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Enable and Start the Service:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable collect_metrics.service
sudo systemctl start
```
